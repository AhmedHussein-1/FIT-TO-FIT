# FIT-TO-FIT
FIT-TO-FIT was an idea that was pitched to UnitedHealth Group's Vice President. The idea behind this app was to incentivise people into
choosing better options when it comes to ordering food.

## Combining Uber Eats with UnitedHealth Group
Uber Eats is the food side of Uber. With this app, you can order food from many different resturaunts and have the food ready at your door
step. With the FIT-TO-FTI app, this would make it easier for people to choose healthy alternatives when it comes to ordering food from 
the Uber Eats app by filtering all the unhealthy foods from the menu and displaying healthy food for the user.
